# poke-app-demo
## Create your own basic Poke-Dex
### Instructions: 

First Clone the Repo, `npm install` then `npm start` to run the server

##### Begin on the `main` branch
Your goal is to follow the instructions in the code comments, and build your own PokeDex!
If you get stuck, you can checkout into the different branches listed below.
Each branch builds on the branch before to get you to the final solution.
Read the corresponding comments to understand what each branch contains. As long as you commit your work to `main`, you can hop into a branch and hop back to your own code to check your work.

###### To checkout into any of these branches
...in your vscode terminal type `git checkout step2` (dont forget to commit or stash your unsaved changes!)
- Ajax Helper Defined
- State values initialized
- Axaj called in useEffect
- Names Render to page

`git checkout step3`
- Refactor AJAX helper to return all data
- set up button clicks to change our url to the next or previoius url
- rendered new lists of pokemon

`git checkout step4`
- Added new state variables to keep track of a single selected pokemon
- Created a second useEffect() to handle our singlePokemon (firing the useEffect() only when the selectedPokemonURL changes)
- console.log the selectedPokemon

`get checkout step5`
- Created FeaturedPokemon component
- Added height and weight to AJAX return values
- Passed props into FeaturedPokemon component
- Render the info
